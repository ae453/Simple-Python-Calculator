# Simple-Python-Calculator
Simple Python calculator I made using Python 3.9. Usable in the run console.

# Code
main_calc.py Is the the main file which controls all the features.
features.py Is the file that holds all the math functions.

# Usage 
This calculator can be used to solve certain math equations. You can find the absolute value of a number, the greatest common divisor, or even just use it for other mathmatical equations. It's simple, and a work in progress.

# Misc
This program is a work in progress, and was one of the first programs I made in Python.
Feel free to make a fork of it so I can learn more about Python, and how I should optimize my code.
